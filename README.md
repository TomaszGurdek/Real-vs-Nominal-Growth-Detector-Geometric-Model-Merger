Two tiny, closed-form tools born in a 2-hour chat with Grok (xAI).

Both are direct practical applications of Frank Nielsen’s beautiful M-mixture Jensen–Shannon divergences  
(arXiv:1904.04017 and recent generalisations).

1. **deflation_score.py** – 15-line detector: “Is this KPI lying because of inflation/deflation?”  
2. **geometric_merge.py** – 3–5× faster model merging using arithmetic / geometric / harmonic means
